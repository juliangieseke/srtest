# srtest

This repo does only exist to better understand and test [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). Don't expect it to do anything useful :)

# Change History

Steps I did manually, tracked here to be able to understand how things work. Its going to be `(branch) description`:

1. (master) initial commit
2. (master) couple bug fixes
3. (beta) branched beta
4. (beta) add feature commit (will conflict with master)
