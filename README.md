This repo does only exist to better understand and test [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). Don't expect it to do anything useful :)

# Change History

Steps I did manually, tracked here to be able to understand how things work. Its going to be `(branch) description`:

1. (master) initial commit
2. (master) couple bug fixes
3. (master) add feature commit
4. (beta) branched beta
5. (beta) add feature commit (confliced with master, rebased)
6. (master) rebased and merged beta
